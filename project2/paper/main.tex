\section{Problem Description}
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Metrorail system in many respects is a driving factor in the
expansion of the city. With Washington's fixed size, reliable and cost-efficient transportation for metro area
residents is crucial for maintaining the city's economy. However, this is a difficult task in that there are many
variables involved, such as human error, mechanical failure, and even acts of nature.

Therefore for this project, I will be simulating the metrorail system using data collected from the WMATA API
\cite{wmataapi}, which provides realtime estimates of train arrival. Furthermore, I will simulate the impact that track
closures have on train throughput.
