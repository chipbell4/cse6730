Questions
- How often do trains really run? Do trains operate as often as WMATA says?
    - Since theres a potential of missing the BRD or ARR state on a train, its best to look for the 1 min mark
    - Look for an arrival in 1min on all directions from the end spots. That should give an idea of when trains first appear near a station
- Is there a particular pattern to when trains run?
    - Using the same 1min criteria, we can find the order that the trains arrive. This may, or may not be useful
- How long does it take for a particular train to move between each pair of stations?
    - For a particular station in a direction and line, query for the 1 min mark. The station down SHOULD be listing a
      time of arrival for the same color. Pick the minimum (there may be more than 1), and subtract 1. Thats the
      estimated time between the two stations
- Given the time to next station can I determine roughly where a train is (i.e. 2 minutes to Farragut West means 20% away).
    - Easy, build a statistical model for train times, which then gives a simple to do fractional distance between the
      stations
- How can I capture delays from the data that I have? What can I learn about how train delays work?
- Can I capture single track behavior? Even if not, can I predict it?
