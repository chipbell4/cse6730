        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Build a simulation of a subset of the Washington Area Metro System</li>
                <li>Subset chosen since no lines intersect, so some lines don't affect others</li>
                <li>Chose a section of track that has the widest variety (three) of train lines running</li>
                <li>A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm">map</a> really helps</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Visually see trains moving through the metro system</li>
                <li>Gain intuition about WMATA's scheduling for train</li>
                <li>Understand how track outages affect train throughput</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Tools used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Similar to the last project, the project was built using
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> and
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> was used for the maps, and adding polygons and
                    what-not.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> was used for testing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Discrete-Event Simulation, using a Backbone collection as an event queue</li>
                <li>Runs in "scaled real-time" so we can change the system's behavior on the fly</li>
                <li>Models to represent individual Trains, Stations, connections between stations, and the entire metro system itself</li>
                <li>Views to represent items on the map, along with statistics and interacting with the system</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Fun Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Trains on the map are colored based on which line they are</li>
                <li>Clicking on a station connection will tell you trains waiting, and tracks disabled</li>
                <li>You can disable tracks on the fly</li>
                <li>The map can be zoomed, dragged, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Input Data</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>WMATA provides an <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.wmata.com/">API</a></li>
                <li>I wrote a cron job that pinged the API every minute for a week.</li>
                <li>Imported them into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a></li>
                <li>
                    This is what I got: <b>2,504,793</b> documents that all look sort of like this: <img src="mongo_document.png" />

                    What is the interarrival time of trains look like?

                Roughly ~30% <span class="blue">Blue</span>, and ~40% for <span class="orange">Orange</span> and <span class="silver">Silver</span></li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Since I'm not perfect, I wrote a nice test suite for the code (as I was writing it). Here's the
                    output at the time of writing. Note that my terminal highlights it nice and green!

                    WMATA posts <a href="http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_to_station_fares.cfm?src_station_id=63&dst_station_id=41&x=57&y=13">time estimates</a>

                <li>
                For instance, WMATA estimates 21 minutes for the entire westward journey. Our simulation gives us similar: <br/><img src="westward_throughput.png"/>

                WMATA's train schedule is spaced enough to provide cushion against track outages with few delays. With a single track blocked
