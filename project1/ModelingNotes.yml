# Things to exclude
Exclusions:
    - Cross-wise traffic blocking the flow of traffic during a green light (gridlock).

Considerations:
    Calculations:
        Csv:
            Input rate of cars:
                - Is it a function of time?
                - Exponential distribution from file
            Turning early off of the street:
                - What type of distribution
        Maps:
            Distance between lights:
                - Calculate from google maps
                - Lane count
    Extras:
        - Lane switches between cars
        - Acceleration rates and speeds of cars
        - Handling car acceleration/decelerating due to light changes, cars ahead accelerating/decelerating
        - Variation in car size
